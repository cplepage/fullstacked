### Welcome to FullStacked!
FullStacked is a npm package that helps with all the development 
setup for a complete web app built with typescript. 
You can skip most of the setup and configuration phase of a 
typical project to rapidly start developing!

### Concept
The idea is to provide all the setup needed for the development 
of a complete web app. In line with that, simple commands allows 
to have everything up and running in a record time. 
No need to think about environments, watcher tools or npm scripts to 
achieve your goals.

### Requirements
The only thing you need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and npm which comes together. 
It hasn't been tested with all versions, but anything `>= 14.14` should be 
all good. Install it from the [official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Recommendations
A good IDE will help a lot with autocompletion. For my part, I 
use [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and I really love it. 
I think [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another popular option too.
My dream would be to have a cloud based one with an efficient types indexer and autocompletion helper, 
but at this point, I didn't find anything that suits my needs. 
Let me know if you ever used a good one!
