# Docker Compose Files

Docker compose files defines all your external tools. You could spin up a database or a full CMS that works in sync with your web app. Use the `[service].docker-compose.yml` file name syntax to split your services into smaller docker-compose files. You can still just use a single long `docker-compose.yml` at the root of your project.
