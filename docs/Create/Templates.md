# Templates

> **Warning**
> 
> Templates are always prepopulated with dummy and placeholder credentials (username, password, secret key). **<u>MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THEM BEFORE DEPLOYING YOUR WEB APP.</u>**

Templates are pre-configured and ready to use libraries/frameworks/external tools for  your FullStacked project. 

Currently, you can only install templates when you init your project, but soon enough you'll be able to add templates to an existant project.

## Available templates

All the templates are currently stored within the `create-fullstacked` repositery. Hopefully soon, we will setup a registry to organize, update and maintain the different templates.

Check them out [here](https://github.com/cplepage/create-fullstacked/tree/main/templates).
