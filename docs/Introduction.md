### Welcome to FullStacked!
FullStacked is a npm package that helps with all the development 
setup for a complete web app built with typescript. 
You can skip most of the setup and configuration phase of a 
typical project to rapidly start developing!

### Concept
The idea is to provide all the setup needed for the development 
of a complete web app. In line with that, simple commands allows 
to have everything up and running in a record time. 
No need to think about environments, watcher tools or npm scripts to 
achieve your goals.
