## Code Editor

A good IDE will definitely improve the experience. [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are two really great options.

## Remote development

We're currently working on a web based IDE designed solely for FullStacked projects. Stay up to date with the development [here](https://ide.fullstacked.org).
