# Requirements

## Remote Development

If you are looking to simply develop a web app, I strongly suggest you tu try [FullStacked IDE](https://ide.fullstacked.org).
It is a web based IDE that wraps FullStacked usage with clean and efficient interfaces!

## Local Development

* NodeJS `>= 16.x`
* Docker and Docker-Compose

### Install Guide
1. Install NodeJS : [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install Docker Desktop : [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Recommendations
A good IDE will help a lot with autocompletion. For my part, I
use [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and I really love it.
I think [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another popular option too.
My dream would be to have a cloud based one with an efficient types indexer and autocompletion helper,
but at this point, I didn't find anything that suits my needs.
Let me know if you ever used a good one!
